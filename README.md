# Java Practice Projects 🚀

This repository contains my Java practice programs.  
I created these files while learning Java step by step.

## What I practiced / learned
- Java basics: variables, input/output, if/else, switch
- Loops: for, while, do-while
- Arrays and 2D arrays
- Classes and Objects (OOP)
- Constructors
- Methods and method overloading
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Small real-life examples (BankAccount, Student, Product)

## Files in this repo (simple description)

### OOP / Inheritance / Polymorphism
- **Animal.java** – Inheritance + polymorphism example (parent Animal, child classes override methods).
- **Vehicles.java** – Polymorphism practice using Vehicle type with different vehicle objects.
- **Inheritance.java** – Basic inheritance practice.
- **Inheritance1.java** – More inheritance practice with extra child features.
- **Inheritance2.java** – Inheritance with method overriding practice.
- **Inheritance3.java** – More inheritance examples (often includes super/overriding practice).

### Classes & Constructors
- **Car.java** – Basic class/object practice using a Car example.
- **ConstructorCar.java** – Constructor practice with Car class.
- **ConStudent.java** – Constructor practice using a Student class.
- **Student.java** – Student class with fields and methods.
- **StudentRecord.java** – Student record management practice (store and print student info).

### Methods
- **Method.java** – Method writing and calling practice.
- **MethodOverloading.java** – Same method name with different parameters (overloading).

### Arrays
- **Arrays.java** – Single-dimensional array practice.
- **TwoDArray.java** – 2D array practice (rows and columns, nested loops).

### Small Programs / Logic
- **Calculator.java** – Simple calculator using conditions and user input.
- **GuessingGame.java** – Number guessing game using loops and conditions.
- **Product.java** – Product example with data and methods.
- **BankAccount.java** – Deposit/withdraw/balance example using OOP.
- **BankAccountCon.java** – BankAccount example with constructor.

## Note about `.class` files
If you see `Main.class`, it is a compiled file created by Java automatically.  
Normally, GitHub repos should include `.java` source files, not `.class` files.

## How to run (example)
1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Make sure Java is installed
3. Run any file that has a `main()` method

Example:
```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
